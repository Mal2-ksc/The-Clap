# The-Clap
SFZ drum kit rompler using only samples generated by my own hands and forearms. Includes a demo track with MIDI. Ideal for pre-industrial hip hop, and covers of Chumbawumba.

The Clap is a drum kit without drums. All samples were generated by my own hands and forearms, by clapping, rubbing, slapping, and snapping. The open hi-hat now mutes on either a closed hi-hat or a foot hi-hat, and this can be edited (directly in the script, details are embedded) for one or both of these control elements.

The layout of percussion instruments is vaguely modeled on the General MIDI standard. Very vaguely.
